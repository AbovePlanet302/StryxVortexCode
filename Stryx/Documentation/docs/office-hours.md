Stryx's goal is to provide extremely fast support times, per our under 4-minute average first response times. However, we're not always available to respond to tickets. Our team is off for all holidays, we'll notify you when we have delayed response times via the messenger. Please keep in mind we may still respond to tickets outside of our office hours. Demos can only be conducted during office hours.
