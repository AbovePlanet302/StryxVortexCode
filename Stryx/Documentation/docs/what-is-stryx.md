# Hello! üëã

Hey there, welcome to the block! We're Stryx, we create services to loop together Discord with Roblox. How are you supposed to know if your group is growing if you don't use a member counter webhook!? I've got no clue.

# What We Offer üëÄ

Here at Stryx, we offer loads of cool services! We currently offer a free member counter that will send updates to a channel of your choice when someone joins/leaves your group! 

We also offer a custom bot that you can customize down to the bone. Our custom bots offer loads of cool commands, including ranking and group management ones! If you don't have $3 a month to spend on a Premium Bot, we're working on a free bot with fewer commands. 

Right now, we're working on mod-call systems and moderation panels for your Roblox game that'll link to your Discord bot, how cool?!

# Why us? üòÅ

Thanks for making it this far! You should use Stryx over other services for a load of reasons, I'll list a few!

- We love providing fast support! During our business hours, our goal is to respond within 2 hours, even though we normally respond within 30 seconds!
- Our services are easy to use and don't take any prior knowledge of anything!
- We love having fun, yet remaining professional! One thing you'll notice is our staff are humans! So they don't act like robots. We use fun emojis too!
- We are community-driven, and we admire that. We host game nights and socialize with our community.
- We love giving back! You got that right, we host giveaways quite often to thank the community for all their on-going support!
