Hiya there! üëã For this article, it's assumed that you already bought a bot code, if not, feel free to read [this help article](purchase-a-bot).

If you paid with PayPal, please check your email for the bot code. If you paid with Robux, the code is given to you in-game upon purchase.

After you get the code, head to [this page](https://vortexhq.net/dashboard). Now locate the server you wish to have the bot in! After that, click on the server name.

After you click on it, you'll be taken to this page;

![Register Token](/img/redeem-bot-code-2.png)

Here you need to enter your token where it says "Enter Token", then hit "Submit". Guess what?! That's it! Boom, nice and simple. Now you can customize your bot! 

To invite the bot to your server, head to this page. After that, locate your application.

Then hit OAuth2.

Copy that URL and open it in a new browser, that is your bot invite link! That's it. üòÅ
