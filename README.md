# StryxVortexCode
I decided to open source Stryx/Vortex HQ's codebase as Stryx is now defunct and moving away from Ro-Tech. Use this code as you may see fit.

Any credentials that may be shown are invalid.

All code shown belongs to me, as Vortex HQ was shut down and rebranded to Stryx, which also has now shut down and is moving into new territory. 

I can not guarantee that this code will work, and will not provide support for it.
